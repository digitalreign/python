# 20190813 page 29 Longer Steps
# Slicing allows for individuals to step based on a value in the final position. THis is not what it is not division, just list order and skipping values.
# Print all values
print(numbers[0:20:1])
# Happens to print the odd numbers
print(numbers[0:20:2])
# Only prints 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 29
print(numbers[0:20:3])
# Only prints 1, 5, 9, 13, 17
print(numbers[0:20:4])
# This can be accomplished by just putting the final value in if you are using the full set of numbers.
print(numbers[::4])
# 20190813 Page 30
# We can't use 0, but can count backwards.
# Count from the 10th value and down by 4 steps.
print(numbers[10::-4])
# Count from 20 as the start value and down by 4 steps until you hit the 10th value.
print(numbers[:10:-4])
# You can add two different sequences together. In this case I am creating a string bacsed on the two earlier lists.
print(numbers[10::-4]+numbers[:10:-4])
# The following line failed because you can't have a list with mixed numbers and letters.
# print(month_name+ordinal+year)

# A value can be printed mulitple times
